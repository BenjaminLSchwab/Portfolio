        <p>I really like software development! I have been coding as a hobby since I was in middle school. Most of this work was just simple text adventure games, but I did get a good understanding of programming fundamentals from this time. Whether Iâ€™m making games or web applications, I get satisfaction from breaking a large problem into small pieces. I like forming a good team and getting a sense of community in my work environment. The logic puzzle aspect of programming really interests me, along with making code run more smoothly / efficiently. I am a quick study and have picked up quite a few languages / frameworks, so getting familiar with a new codebase is a welcome challenge. I would be an asset to your team!</p>
